------------------------------- SPRING BOOT BASIC --------------

1. spring boots is an extended version o the spring.

2. it is loosely coupled , Depedency injection. inversion of control.

3. Depedency injjection means we dont need to create object spring wil create.

4. spring is used to develope entriprise application.

5. spring boot follows convension over configuration means less configs compared to spring

6. spring boot has embeded server tomcat.

7. Hybernate provides JPA for database connection

8. Controller --> Entity Layer || Service Layer --> Repo --> DB

------------------------ DEPEDENCY INJECTION ---------------

1. creating the class object automatically.

2. when we create an object it created on jvm heap memory. but if we create it in spring that will be 
   created in IOC container in IVM that will provide loosely coupling and DI. 
   that is call Application Context

3. there ara threee types of injection
   1. Field injection --> injecting values to objet properties
   2. constructor injection --> injecting values using object constructor
   3. Setter Injection --> injection values using object Setter funtion


---------------------------- SCOPE OF THE OBJECT -----------

1. Singleton --> when we create a same class object, if we set or chnage the prop value.
   it will reflect on the another same class object.

2. ProtoType -->  when we create a same class object, if we set or chnage the prop value.
   it will doesnot reflect on the another same class object. creates new object container.
